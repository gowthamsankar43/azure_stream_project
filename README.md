# Building a Real-Time E-commerce Analytics Pipeline with Azure

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I built a real-time analytics pipeline for an e-commerce platform using Azure technologies. This pipeline ingests, processes, and stores customer order data, enabling real-time insights into customer behavior.

## Key Components:

* **Data Generation:** I used Python and the Faker library to simulate real-time order data, mimicking a live e-commerce platform.
* **Kafka Streaming:** A Confluent Kafka cluster acts as the backbone for real-time data ingestion. It efficiently captures and streams order data.
* **Azure Fabric Integration:**
    * **Event Hubs:** Fabric Event Hubs capture the streaming data from Kafka, ensuring reliable and scalable data ingestion.
    * **Azure Data Lake Storage:** The processed data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage for efficient storage and future analysis.
    * **Azure Databricks:** I leveraged Azure Databricks for data transformation and manipulation within the data lake.
* **Real-time Power BI Dashboard:** A visually appealing Power BI dashboard displays key order metrics directly from the data lake, providing real-time insights into customer behavior.

This project showcases the power of Azure services in building robust and scalable real-time analytics pipelines. By combining Kafka, Azure Fabric, and Power BI, I gained valuable experience in building data-driven solutions for e-commerce platforms.
